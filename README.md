# Sudoku Solver

This program takes a sudoku board and solves it instantly. The user inputs their sudoku board into the system and upon running it, the program will output the solved sudoku board. The program is written in Python.

Currently, I am still working on developing a UI for the code so the user does not have to manually input their board into the program.
As well, I am developing a way to determine if the inputted board is solvable or not.
